			<h2>Machine Learning Explained</h2>
			<p>
				Machine learning is the ability of computers to complete tasks without being directly programmed. This is done by training/teaching a mathematical model(on the computer) first with data. After the model is trained, the model can complete a task it is trained to do. Some examples can be a model recognizing a picture of a circle or a square, or predicting the weather on a certain day.
